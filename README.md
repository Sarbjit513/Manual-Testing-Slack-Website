## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates my manual testing skills through a focused set of test cases and bug reports for Slack's website (slack.com). As a QA tester, I've analyzed key user journeys on Slack's website to verify functionality, identify potential issues, and document my findings in a professional format.

This portfolio contains the following key documents:

- **Test Cases** (`test-cases.md`): Three comprehensive test cases covering core website functionality
- **Bug Report** (`bug-report.md`): Documentation of issues discovered during testing
- **Test Summary** (`test-summary.md`): Overall analysis and recommendations

## Testing Approach

My testing approach for this project included:

1. Identifying key user journeys on Slack's website
